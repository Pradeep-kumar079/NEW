      A Vehicle Booking System is a digital platform that enables users to rent vehicles conveniently and efficiently. Designed for personal and commercial purposes, it simplifies the process of searching, selecting, and booking vehicles like cars, bikes, or vans. The system features a user-friendly interface where customers can browse vehicle options, check availability, make reservations, and process secure payments.  
      
      Administrators can manage vehicle inventory, bookings, user accounts, and generate performance reports through an intuitive admin panel. The system supports real-time availability updates, integration with payment gateways, and optional features like GPS tracking and dynamic pricing.  
      
      Built using modern technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and databases like MongoDB, the platform ensures scalability and reliability. By automating booking processes, it enhances customer experience, reduces operational overhead, and supports businesses in meeting the growing demand for flexible and on-demand transportation services.
